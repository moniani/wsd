						<ol>
							<li>Include a path that is designed to lead people to the front door.</li>
							<li>Use protective landscaping in the front of buildings located on busy streets, culde-sacs, or T-junctions</li>
							<li>Install gates or open-up side yard fencing so that the Chíi can circulate around the entire building. </li>
							<li>When the building is comprised of straight lines and angles, choose meandering 
								lines for pathways, patios, garden walls, etc.   </li>
							<li>Create aesthetically pleasing storage areas for trash containers, lumber, garden 
								supplies, etc.  Donít allow these items to collect and become junk piles.</li>
							<li>Lift properties that are located below street level with strong horizontal lines 
								such as terraces, and strong vertical lines such as trees, flagpoles, walls, etc.  
								Lighting can also be used to strengthen horizontal and vertical lines.  Same 
								applies to properties that slope down in the back.</li>
